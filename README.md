# Library
Assignment from the Odin project curriculum. ([link](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library))

#### Build a small library app.

Features
- Adding books and deleting existing ones.
- Toggling the whether the book has been already read.
- The data is stored in Local Storage.
- Books are displayed as "cards" which you can sort (ascending or descending), according to:

	* title

	* author

	* insertion

	* length

	* read status

- The current number of read, unread and total books is displayed in the bottom left corner.

#### Comment

Really had fun with this project! It enabled me to practice styling, managing input, making the page look and feel intuitive and responsive. Learned a lot about compatibility, as I made my best to make the app look presentable and work as intended on various browsers, including on mobile. Noticed a big improvement in fluency with HTML/CSS/JS while doing it.

The assignment said nothing about sorting, but it felt appropriate to implement that function. Sorting by author makes sure to use the last name as a basis of sorting, including in cases of multiple authors (in that case, it uses the first author, assumed to be the most important), and also works with monomymous authors. Made my first forays into RegEx while coding it.
